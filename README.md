# eluvio-option3

Notes:

Written in Javascript and uses mapLimit from the async library(https://www.npmjs.com/package/async) and XMLHttpRequest.

Main function getIds and two helper functions, LoadIds and its callback printResults. 

Assumptions/Problems:
I assumed the given ids are similar to the one given in the example GET request in length as well as the GET request url given is correct and functioning. I also assumed the response from the API would be in JSON. I did not know how to store in information retrieved so I printed it to the console. 
When I tried the example GET request in the e-mail it returned a 404 page.
